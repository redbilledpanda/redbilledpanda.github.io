This post here marks my (re)entry into the, rather complex world of "Modern" C++. Apparently, the language has changed a LOT from the days of C++11. This post here marks my quasi (un)official foray back into the murky waters that lie ahead! Wish me luck and good cheer :). 

We'd start with topics like copy and move, some intracacies of the 'auto' keyword. Thats all for now. Check out my next post on Copy and Move coming up soon enough!
