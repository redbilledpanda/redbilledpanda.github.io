This post here marks my (re)entry into the, rather complex world of "Modern" C++. Apparently, the language has changed a LOT from the days of C++11. This post here marks my quasi (un)official foray back into the murky waters that lie ahead! Wish me luck and good cheer :).

But I may not restrict myself to C++ and might branch off to other topics if and when I see fit. After all, we all need a little digression here and there. I am, after all, the king of my virtual castle here :).
